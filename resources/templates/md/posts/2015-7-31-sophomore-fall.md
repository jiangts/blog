It's time to choose classes at Stanford!

Unfortunately (fortunately?) there are too many cool CS classes to take at
Stanford during the fall. Classes currently on my radar that are only offered
fall quarter are:

- CS144 - Networking
  - in this class you basically learn how the internet works. It's inverted
      classroom style, so you watch videos about theory at home and talk about
      it in class. Having watched some videos out of curiosity, I can say that
      they're really fascinating, and the professors do a great job detailing
      the internet, one of the greatest engineering feats of modern technology.
      The class is known to be one of the harder CS classes at Stanford though,
      because you literally have to implement a lot of networking protocols in
      C. I think the first assignment is writing a TCP server from a provided
      bare-bones implementation of a UDP server. -- Really excited to take this
      one!
- CS251 - Bitcoin
  - This one is taught by Dan Boneh, (one of?) the world's greatest expert(s) on
      computer security. I'm taking this one probably half because I want to
      take a class with Dan and half because I think bitcoin is interesting
      itself as a technology (and I want to know what the fuss is about, as I've
      never actually looked into it).
- CS229 - Machine Learning
  - This was Andrew Ng's famous class, so I feel somewhat obligated as a
      Stanford CS kid to take it.  It's actually known to not be the most
      organized class (it had more students than CS106a last fall!) and I hear
      some things are brushed over rather quickly, so it's imperative I put in
      some extra time on learning the material if I actually want to know it.
      But I still think it'll be super cool.
- CS221 - AI
  - A lot of older CS students told me to take this instead of 229, while others
      told me it was a relatively easy class. In any case, I don't have space on
      my schedule to take this class because it conflicts with 251, but I'll
      definitely keep my ears perked to see what my friends have to say about
      it. Who knows, I might even take a look at their problem sets or course
      notes from time to time.
- CS131 - Computer Vision
  - This just sounds cool. Not many of my friends have talked about it, but I
      think it would be super interesting. However, not tryna take 4 CS classes
      this next quarter so it'll have to wait...
- CS145 - Databases
  - I already took a databases class in HS where we talked about 6 normal
      forms in relational databases and went over basic queries. We also talked
      about NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Riak, HBase, and Neo4J, of which I've
      only used PostgreSQL and MongoDB semi-extensively. We also learned about
      the CAP theorem and ACID compliance and the pros and cons of various
      databases, but at the end of the day it wasn't so rigorous as it was only
      a HS class. Hopefully this class will bring some rigor into what I learned
      before and teach me new things when I take it next year.

I'm also looking at taking Social Dance which is one of the most highly demanded
classes at Stanford, (aka click enroll at exactly midnight!) and Math110 which
is Number Theory. I figured I had to throw a math class in there to keep me
thinking rigorously. Also I miss math, as I only took 1 math class last year
:(.

So those are my plans for now, and I'll append an update to this post when I
actually finalize my schedule!
