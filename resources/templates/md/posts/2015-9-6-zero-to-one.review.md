I've been reading Peter Thiel's [Zero to One](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296) 
this summer, and want to note my thoughts on it. First and foremost, I believe the
main value of the book is *not* from its specific startup tips or advice. If
you want that, go read Paul Graham's [essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) 
or Sam Altman's [blog](http://blog.samaltman.com/). Better yet,
follow them on Twitter (@paulg and @sama).

Instead, the ideas in the book are valuable because they describe a *way of thinking*. 
For example, the book describes Thiel's mindset when approaching a variety of
topics, from business to economics to politics to the value of college, etc. But most
importantly, the book describes Thiel's mindset on the advancement of humanity
(or what he calls "technology", or "the future"). To me, it seems that the book is
80% about mindset and 20% about concrete advice [\[0\]](#0).


First off, a couple questions.

#### Should you read this book?

Yes.

A friend told me he hadn't read the book yet because he thought Peter Thiel was too
radical and somewhat of a hypocrite (Why is he encouraging kids to drop out of
college when he has so many Stanford degrees? How can he speak out against
competition when he benefitted so much from the capitalist system? [\[1\]](#1)).

Even if you are in this camp, you should read the book. Why? Zero To One 
is akin to a book on mathematics in the sense that Thiel starts with
one key assumption/axiom, and then describes many theorems, results, and
corollaries that one should logically believe if they hold the starting
assumption to be true. And what's his driving assumption? It's that going from
Zero to One, or making new technology where none existed before, is **the most important thing**
for people to do. I think this is a premise that
many would in fact be sympathetic towards, so in reading Zero to One, the reader gets
to see a simple premise driven to its logical end on the many topics that
Thiel discusses. The conclusions Thiel draws then lead one to reflect on their
mindset towards those topics, even if Thiel's conclusions seem extreme at first. If you are interested Thiel's premise and its implications,
reading this book will do a lot of the hard thinking for you and springboard you
into a place where you can decide first what you believe about his view-points
and second what you actually think about his starting premise.

#### Why this post?

This post aims to describe

1. the key surprising results from the book
2. how these results affect one's mindset

Surprising results, are (unsurprisingly) ideas that don't play nicely with
conventional knowledge. To that end, I'll try to avoid lots of discussion on
the pretty widely accepted ideas in the book, such as "have a 10x advantage in either
technology, network effects, economies of scale, or branding".

Before I begin I should state a caveat: I'm not necessarily interested in the
absolute truth. Rather, I'm interested in what type of mindset will make me the
most effective. When these two things don't coincide, I actually seek the
latter. This is generally my philosophy [in chess](TODO chess religion), and in
many instances, [in life](TODO spinning top).

##### Bravery over genius

##### Avoid competition

- Escape the competition!
- Axel's thing with the popcorn bag.
- Baking your own cakes and pies. (maybe a separate short post about my experience).

##### Don't Disrupt

Although this is strictly a corollary of the "escape competition" idea, I figure
the terminology of "disrupting an industry" is prevalent enough that it deserves
its own short section.

Thinking of oneself as a "disruptor" in an industry
makes one understand their business in an inherently competitive way. Instead,
the act of creation is far more important than trying to annoy the incumbents.

Instead of going for "disruption" which is a zero-sum game, create something
new and generate new value. That allows you to escape the competition as much as
possible.

To reiterate, redefine yourself as something new, not through the eyes of an
existing company. Yes, that means goodbye to "we're the X for Y".
([Uber for Tinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le4rd8B37fk) what??). And
yes, I do get slightly annoyed when people tell me my idea is like "X for Y".
