First day of classes all fantastic.

ML class about building blocks of ML (e.g. the various techniques from linear regression to SVMs to Neural Networks to K-means clustering) 
but more excitingly, diagnosing where to go next.

Argument is that in any ML problem there can be as many as 10-15 different approaches you can take.
For example,

- gathering more features
- acquiring more data (often expensive)
- altering the algorithm (learning rate, bias adjustment, etc)

Social dance was awesome.
Learned some basic swing dance moves.
Super light hearted, fun, instructor is great.
A great way to relax. Two of my other good friends are in the class as well.

Bitcoin class is fantastic as well. Really going into the theory of the bitcoin protocol itself.
Dan Boneh being a crypto guy, likes being rigorous and it's really enlightening and fun.

Talked about binding commitments and digital signatures. Merkle trees. Wow!

Expect some posts about these topics. It'll help me learn them.
